Despite tests on a smaller document, I cannot seem to get beyond printing the initial state. I also tried calculating but that does not seem to work. The functions are not added to take input and output from the command line. I also got confused on the details of computing probability. It is one thing to say P(tag | word), but another to figure what the probability for the input and output would be. 

I had solved the problem of storing the data in the array of hashes. Now I cannot seem to get the information out. Somehow, even printing it by array and specifying a key did not work. I have no idea why it worked earlier and it is not working now. 

These were the functions I could not write without diagnosing the &CountLines problem. 

#sub CalculateTrigramStates{
#Use &StateNumber three times, and multiply it by 
#&WordToPOSNumber used for the three words
#}

#sub CountActualSymbols{}
#sub CountActualStates{}

#sub DoesArcSumEqualOne{}
#sub DoesSymbolSumEqualOne{}
#sub DoesStateSumEqualOne{}

I hope these notes show that I can do some of the work.
