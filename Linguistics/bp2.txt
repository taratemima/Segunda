A 1922 BP advertisement.
BP p.l.c.[4][5] is a global oil and gas company headquartered in London, United Kingdom. It is
the third largest energy company and the fourth largest company in the world.[6] It is one of
the six "supermajors" (vertically integrated private sector oil exploration, natural gas, and
petroleum product marketing companies).[7]

The name "BP" derives from the initials of one of the company's former legal names, British
Petroleum.[8][9] It has operations in over 80 countries and its largest division is BP America,
which is the biggest producer of oil and natural gas in the United States and is headquartered
in Houston, Texas.[10][11][12]

BP is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It has
a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange.

An April 2010 explosion of BP's Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, in which 11 people died, led to
an oil spill that contaminated a large area of United States marine environment along the Gulf
of Mexico. Consequences of the spill included an over 50% drop in BP's stock price,[13]
damage to the environment, and a decrease in fishing and tourism[14][15][16][17][18]
projected to impact the region for several years.[19]
