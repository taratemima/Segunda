#From this that eludes me which I pen this – as what I say what eludes me is sleep, and from the sleep becomes the etchings where the dreams begin.
#Such thoughts should be erased as the Y2K virus, in the eyes of the rural Christians - in the hall of mirrors. 
#Only as one thinks this, I am alone - I am no one, one that is hunted as a witch by the rural individuals whom look at the Bible as the only book one should be reading. 
#Lurking as an apparition in the cavern -- the cavern which is concieved of cold concrete and rusted pipes; the shapeless shadow which is seen in the eyes of a writer whom had visited the place called Lower Wacker Drive in the dead of a Chicago winter.
#It was him that said I should not dress the way I was because I would be hunted down as a witch, or one whom had a morbid intrest in the fear of the unknown (within one's darkest fears -- the thoughts that should not be are as a sin, are a way of demonic openings.)
#The first story was titled Anchorwoman -- A Journal with the help of my former landlord who also owned a pet shop. 
#My imagination is troubled as a person with a drug addiction, an addiction that is similar to one who'd been taking Crank. 
#Beneath them which brings into the darkness – it would become from a foreboding and ominous sound from the sky;  that sound – the hissing of small insect wings flying in swarms.  Swarms as they would become in the color of the fog,   darkness as they fly with the echo of nightfall.
#It would be covered in hornets and locusts in the way it was described – from patterns that dwell in the pages as they were written from the perspective of the writer who writes them. 
#But then again, I was no stranger to the practices of Satanism and the occult which I will describe later on where a person had done a tarot reading on me.
#That as one would be reading this that I wrote would say that I have gone evil, but what I write has some truth to it. 
#I had been one of a dark historian since Glen Ellyn in strongly influenced by Wheaton College. 
#Thoughts that are concieved in the eyes of philosophy are what I would often ponder on such #as what does make the center hold.

# When one would visit Naperville and Joliet, The thoughts that would be inside of their mind as #they are mesmorized by the old Gregorian structures and Victorian Gothic designs. One can #only see inside of the thoughts that would remain -- knowing that a mother murdered her own #children in one of the houses in Naperville, and in Joliet, a woman -- who was a nurse had been #strangled and the house burned to hide the remains of the bizarre homicide. 

#According to the patrons, one had said that the paintings would look at them with evil eyes.
