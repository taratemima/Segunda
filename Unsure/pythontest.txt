stringorder1 = "If I knew how to program, I could make more money."

If I could talk to people, I would be in a better job.

If I had more money, I could have gone back to school sooner.

I was floundering with the assignment, and could not figure out how to solve the syntax errors or how slow the computer was.

I passed computer science classes, but I had no idea why.

I could not understand why I was making mistakes, and I could not understand what I was doing right.

I found a stop-gap job.

Seven years later, I could not leave for something 'better'.

Despite offshoring trends, I felt that if I knew programming, I could get a better job, better pay, and a better life.

First thing, I write documentation, fiction, and journals.

I wrote many pieces for a technical writing portfolio.

Some of it I still show off.

Some of it, I look at and see that I could do better.

"What are you doing here? You know nothing."

I had a revelation--I could program for myself.

I could program ways to sort through what I have written, to merge and compare documents, and to remind myself of appointments.

I could get software for these tasks, but they may not work with each other or I could not afford it.

I rather not buy 'warez', so perhaps, I could code it myself.

Perhaps?

In school, I was so busy trying to imitate other students and to do things as I was taught in class. 

I forgot that I could use a programming language as a tool, not as a measuring stick of how 'ready' I was.

I could code for my own purposes. 

I could code to make my life easier.

I had no idea where to start.

Life got in the way of learning.

I decided that I was not good enough at programming to get a coding job.

When I did my manic search for a job after graduation, I did not send resumes for programmer positions.

def function_name(parameter_1,parameter_2):
    {this is the code in the function}
    {more code}
    {more code}
    return {value to return to the main program}
{this code isn't in the function}
{because it isn't indented}
#remember to put a colon ":" at the end
#of the line that starts with 'def'

openfile = open('pathtofile', 'r')
openfile.read()


#format is [variable].readlines()

#reads a text fle and returns it as an index of strings

#May store file contents as a list and then make changes, or use dictionary format.





What I want the program to do:

Read from an outside file.
Have the sentences as separate strings.
Compare the strings.
Have them grouped by keywords.
Have me rate the possible order that they could go.
Have strings with the same order value compared.
Continue until all are sorted.
Print the strings in order.
If not correct, figure out how to make it correct. 

(Save original outside file to test any code changes)

Assign random keys to string entries

Compare two keys and print the strings associated with them
If out of order, swap
Else, go to the next strings

What if the dictionary entries are an odd number?
